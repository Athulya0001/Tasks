    <section id="border-container">
        <span>Welcome to my brain! I curated the look and feel of an entire house to match my aesthetic – the ambiance,
            the design, the menu and of course, the music for the evening. If I’m being real with you, this is not
            something I have ever done before. But this was too cool of an opportunity to give something to my fans
            they’ve never seen before. This is a once-in-a-lifetime experience for both of us.</span>
        <br><br>
        <span><b>What you’ll do</b></span>
        <br>
        <span>I am inviting you to step in my world, where you’ll see my artistry up close and personal. I created the
            perfect space for you to view some precious family heirlooms – my grandmother’s paintings – followed by a
            delicious feast of my favourite foods, all leading to an intimate performance of my songs in the living
            room. But since I’m opening up in a way I never have before, you have to participate a bit as well. I’ve
            left you a probing question on the vanity that requires you to bare a little of your own soul. It’s only
            fair.</span>
        <br><br>
        <span>I hope you come out the other side inspired to create something of your own.</span>
        <br><br>
        <span>• Take in some of my grandmother’s hand-painted artwork on pedestals while the silhouettes of Greek
            statues take YOU in from behind the fabric, all set to a curated playlist that matches the experience.
        </span>
        <br><br>
        <span>• Hungry? I’ve set up an elegant feast in the dining room – fruits, cheeses and caviar for your stomach
            and my signature aesthetic for your mind. </span>
        <br><br>
        <span>• I’ve left a simple but deep question for you on the vanity mirror. It’s up to you how you answer it.
            There are paintbrushes, markers and more. Grab whatever feels most natural and write whatever’s inside you.
            Oh, and leave a message for me in the guestbook!</span>
        <br><br>
        <span>• At the end of the night, I’ll take centre stage for a performance in the living room. I might sing new
            songs or some of my all-time faves, or both. Let’s see where the mood takes us.</span>
        <br><br>
        <span><b>Other things to note</b></span>
        <br>
        <span>I can only withstand this exchange of energies for so long, so this is not a stay.</span>
